######################
In order to be able to use the code in the package, you have to launch the config script *only the first time*
source doFirstConfig.csh
This configures the directory to work on lxcms02, where the rootuples are stored.

######################

In order to compile the rootuple creating classes, issue

gmake all

You can then look at an example on how to run the rootuple maker in execute_8TeV.csh

######################

In order to create the final root file containing the RooDataSets for the scan issue

root -l mergeDataSets.C

In order to fit the mZ2 distribution, you can issue

root -l fit_MZ2.C
